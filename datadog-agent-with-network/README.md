# datadog-agent-with-network

This image is used to collect TCP connection and conntrack metrics when running network integration with the datadog agent.
This issue is already on [github](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/issues/4370). I will remove this image if this response is received.

## Usage

```
$ docker run chatwork/datadog-agent-with-network
```
